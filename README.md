# No Longer Maintained

I wrote this class in 2002, back when:

 *  I was just learning about OOP in PHP
 *  I actually used CommunigatePro
 *  I had no children
 *  I lived on a farm
 *  I was a mostly-unemployed independent contractor (it was 2002, after all)
  
Since then, my wife and I have had two kids, we've relocated to the Bay Area,
I've written more (and better) OO code for PHP5 than I care to remember, and 
I've founded/co-founded two startups.

Oh, and I've stopped using CommunigatePro.

Still, I get asked for this code from time to time (about every 6 months), and 
I typically respond by sending it out attached to a reply to whomever asked for 
it.

Looking back on this code now, it's not my finest work (at least it is free
of ereg_* functions) ... but now it's available for whomever needs it.

Please fork at will! The class will no doubt be better served by someone who's 
actually using CommunigatePro on a regular basis.

Thanks to all who've continued asking me for the library. It feels good to have
written something that's still semi-useful 8 years later.
